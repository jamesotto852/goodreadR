**goodreadR** exports several functions for scraping and tidying user data from [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com/).
Internally, these tasks are handled via [**rvest**](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/), [**stringr**](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/), and other [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages.

## Installation

You can install **goodreadR** from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jamesotto852/goodreadR")
```

## Getting User data

The main function for getting user data is `get_read()`.
It accepts a profile url as its argument and returns a tibble of the scraped user data.
Below, I show the data from my profile as an example:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library("goodreadR")
library("tidyverse")

df <- get_read("https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/98834377-james")
  
glimpse(df)

```

You may have noticed that in the above example, the columns with dates (`pub_date`, `start_date`, etc.) are not machine-readable.
This is remedied via `fix_dates()` which cleans the output of `get_read()`.

```{r}
df |>
  fix_dates() |>
  select(ends_with("date")) |>
  glimpse()
```

Note: each value of `start_date` is `NA`.
This is not an error---I just do not set start dates on my goodreads account!

***

Finally, if you know your username, `get_profile_url()` will return the corresponding url (ready for `get_read()`):

```{r}
get_profile_url("bookononism")
```

## Awards data

**goodreadR** also includes data for various literary awards, scraped from [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com).
Currently, `df_Hugo`, `df_Nebula`, `df_Clarke`, and `df_World_Fantasy` are included.
I hope to add more in the future, keeping them up-to-date.

```{r}
df_Hugo
```

## Goodreads Dashboard

I have also developed a [**shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app which makes use of this package---facilitating the exploration of data from any [goodreads.com](https://goodreads.com) user profile.
See it in action [here](https://jamesotto.app/Goodreads-Dashboard)!
